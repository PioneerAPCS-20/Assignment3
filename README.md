# Assignment 3

Create a program that takes temperature as input (using the `Scanner` class) and outputs the conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Formula: **C = 5 / 9 * (F - 32)**

## Example Outputs

```
Enter the degrees in Fahrenheit: 85
Your converted temperature in Celsius is 29.444
```

```
Enter the degrees in Fahrenheit: -22
Your converted temperature in Celsius is -30
```

### Challenge

If you are looking for a challenge, try to make a program that will do the conversion in either direction depending on what the user chooses. However, you must do this without using conditionals (if statements).

For example:

```
Enter the degrees: 27

<Ask them if they want to convert from C to F or F to C>

The answer is: <answer>
```

### Grading

Your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style (following naming conventions for identifiers, proper indentation, and proper spacing). Also, remember to put your name at the top of your file. There is also a rubric on the Canvas assignment page.
